	- Type: Some characters exhibit specific types within their respective species. For instance, they might be identified as Corn-person, Giant Cat Monster, Lizards, or even Toy entities. This variety showcases the creativity and imagination behind the show's character designs, offering a wide range of intriguing beings.
	- Gender: Characters in Rick and Morty can have various gender identities, including female, male, genderless, or an unknown gender specification. This diversity reflects the show's commitment to exploring different character traits and identities.

## Benefits of Not Using Frameworks like Bootstrap

One of the primary advantages of not using frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap is the freedom it offers in crafting a custom and lightweight solution tailored to specific project needs. By avoiding reliance on pre-built components, developers have greater control over:

-   **Performance:** Hand-crafted code tends to be leaner, resulting in faster load times and reduced bandwidth usage.
-   **Flexibility:** Custom implementations allow for more flexibility and creativity in design and functionality.
-   **Learning and Skill Enhancement:** Building without frameworks encourages a deeper understanding of underlying technologies and coding principles.
